Being able to use just keys to do a lot of things without touching your mouse is pretty awesome. But I can&#39;t constantly be on my laptop. I mean sure, with the pandemic, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve done, but <s>if</s> when it gets over, I&#39;ll be on the move. I can&#39;t turn on my laptop for every damn thing. I <em>need</em> to have the things I am working with on my phone too, especially things like the calendar. Now you get to read about the things I&#39;ve tried to set up a TUI calendar which also syncs to my phone.</p> <h2 id=on_my_laptop ><a href="#on_my_laptop" class=header-anchor >On my laptop</a></h2> <p>Conclusion: Calcurse. Beautiful.</p> <p>I first tried <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/remind"><code>remind</code></a> with <a href="https://github.com/haguenau/wyrd"><code>wyrd</code></a>, but it just seemed too... much. It&#39;s pretty cool, but it seems to have a very condensed UI, and I prefer more open UIs</p> <p>Then I tried <a href="https://www.calcurse.org/"><code>calcurse</code></a>. With a pretty light UI and sensible &#40;read vim-like&#41; key bindings, it&#39;s super easy to get a hang of. Creating, editing and other stuff is pretty easy. Also, the notes feature is pretty awesome as it allows me to add pesky zoom links which have a tendency to get mixed up. Zoom should just give a random name to their meetings, like yellow-monkey-poop or something. It might even bring some joy into a dreary life of pointless Zoom meetings. Anywho, I pretty much stuck to calcurse.</p> <p>But then I read about khal in <a href="https://hund.tty1.se/2020/08/12/how-to-sync-and-manage-your-caldav-and-carddav-via-the-terminal.html">hund&#39;s blog</a> and decided to try it. The interface is a bit different, with way too many months shown at once, and the key bindings are weird too. It seemed like there were 3 layers to the UI- the month layer, the day layer and the event layer. Calcurse on the other hand uses a single layer with 3 parallel sections, the to-do, appointments and the month. Calcurse just looked better, but khal isn&#39;t far behind.</p> <h2 id=syncing_with_other_laptops ><a href="#syncing_with_other_laptops" class=header-anchor >Syncing with other laptops</a></h2> <p>Now comes the real issue. Syncing. Sure I could set up a CalDav server, but I don&#39;t have a static IP, and if I go back to my institute, I will not be able to access my laptop. Also, my laptop has to always be up, which is not the case. Plus, implementing my own set up would be a pretty painful task.</p> <p>I could use some online server, but I couldn&#39;t find any services which were not self-hosting. Also, I wouldn&#39;t be able to store the calcurse format, instead store an ical which I convert on opening calcurse, which seems dumb.</p> <p>My solution was git. Git is device and OS-agnostic, and I already know how to use it. Plus I get a change history for free, though I assume that at some point the history will get too large, and I&#39;ll have to squash previous commits, but that&#39;s like a once in a year thing. Putting it on a remote server also ensures that it is backed up, so even if my beauty of a laptop dies, I&#39;d still have my calendar.</p> <p>You can make the calcurse directory a git repo and add <a href="https://calcurse.org/files/manual.html#_hooks">hooks</a> to commit and push in post-save and pull in pre-load. I used GitHub as the remote repo, but you could use anything of your choice. Now in another device, all I had to do was clone the calcurse directory, and I&#39;d be done. Since literally everything from settings to hooks was in the same place, it would work exactly the same in all devices.</p> <h2 id=calcurse_on_android ><a href="#calcurse_on_android" class=header-anchor >Calcurse on Android</a></h2> <p>The final issue. Phone syncing.</p> <p>My first attempt was to simply try to extend the same set up to android via <a href="https://termux.com/">termux</a>. While that worked, calcurse was pretty hopeless on such a tiny screen with a soft keyboard. TUIs are not made for touch screens. I tried wyrd and khal too, but they weren&#39;t easy to use either.</p> <p>I knew I could get the calcurse data onto the phone, it was the UI that was a problem. I briefly thought about making an app which could parse and display calcurse data, but then remembered the painful thing that is Android development. Plus I would basically have to rewrite the calcurse parser which itself is in constant development, which would mean my thing would have to be in constant development. No, thanks.</p> <p>I then dabbled with exporting an ical file from calcurse on exit, which worked fine, and I was able to import it into my calendar&#40;<a href="https://www.simplemobiletools.com/calendar/">Simple Calendar</a>&#41; too. At first, it would import the data multiple times, but then I found out that adding <code>--export-uid</code> while exporting from calcurse prevented that from happening, so that was fine. But the major issue was that I would have to run the git pull myself and then open the ics file with the calendar. Then too, events which were deleted from calcurse wouldn&#39;t be deleted from the calendar, as events would be imported and merged to the default calendar.</p> <p>I needed a calendar app which would basically only display the ics file, that&#39;s all. Not knowing any apps, I just typed <code>ics</code> into Aurora Droid and I found <a href="https://icsx5.bitfire.at/">ICSx⁵</a>. This was perfect. I could sync a CalDav server, and it would work perfectly.</p> <p>But this cycled back to the first issue. I don&#39;t want to set up CalDav. Then I thought of just trying to &quot;sync&quot; a URL which was just the link to an ics file. I used the <code>raw</code> link of the exported ics in my calcurse repo, and it worked&#33;</p> <p>Now, any time I edit the calendar on my laptop, it exports the calendar to an ics, commits it the repo, pushes to GitHub. From there, ICSx⁵ syncs the changes to my calendar when I refresh in the app.</p> <p>Success&#33;</p> <h2 id=still_not_the_best ><a href="#still_not_the_best" class=header-anchor >Still not the best</a></h2> <p>This set up is still not perfect. I cannot make changes on my calendar app which propagate to the laptop. I have to fall back to the calcurse CLI or TUI to add an event via termux. It&#39;s not a dealbreaker, especially since I don&#39;t have too many updates anyway, but a person can dream.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Dhruva Sambrani.
