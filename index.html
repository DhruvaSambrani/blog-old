I study Physics at IISER Mohali and am interested in QCQI. I&#39;m also an avid coder in Julia and Python, and I know C&#43;&#43; and a bit of Java. I also have a main <a href="https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/">website-cv</a> thing which may interest you.</p> <p>Well, hope you enjoy reading my blog, whether you agree with me or not&#33; Please do reach out via the links on the left&#33;</p> <h2 id=recent_posts ><a href="#recent_posts" class=header-anchor >Recent Posts</a></h2> <details><summary>My Calendar Setup on 2021-08-20</summary><h1 id=my_calendar_setup ><a href="#my_calendar_setup" class=header-anchor >My calendar setup</a></h1> <h2 id=the_problem ><a href="#the_problem" class=header-anchor >The Problem</a></h2> <p>I love TUIs. Being able to use just keys to do a lot of things without touching your mouse is pretty awesome. But I can&#39;t constantly be on my laptop. I mean sure, with the pandemic, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve done, but <s>if</s> when it gets over, I&#39;ll be on the move. I can&#39;t turn on my laptop for every damn thing. I <em>need</em> to have the things I am working with on my phone too, especially things like the calendar. Now you get to read about the things I&#39;ve tried to set up a tui calendar which also syncs to my phone.</p> <h2 id=on_my_laptop ><a href="#on_my_laptop" class=header-anchor >On my laptop</a></h2> <p>Conclusion: Calcurse. Beautiful.</p> <p>I first tried <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/remind"><code>remind</code></a> with <a href="https://github.com/haguenau/wyrd"><code>wyrd</code></a>, but it just seemed too... much. It&#39;s pretty cool, but it seems to have a very condensed UI, and I prefer more open UIs</p> <p>Then I tried <a href="https://www.calcurse.org/"><code>calcurse</code></a>. With a pretty light UI and sensible &#40;read vim-like&#41; key bindings, its super easy to get a hang of. Creating, editing and other stuff is pretty easy. Also, the notes feature is pretty awesome as it allows me to add pesky zoom links which have a tendency to get mixed up. Zoom should just give a random name to their meetings, like yellow-monkey-poop or something. It might even bring some joy into a dreary life of pointless zoom meetings.</p> <p><a href="posts/2021-08-20 010631">Read more</a></p> </details> <details><summary>Closer to Truth on 2021-08-20</summary><h1 id=closer_to_truth ><a href="#closer_to_truth" class=header-anchor >Closer to Truth</a></h1> <p>I was going to the mall when I saw three people sitting on the bench. As I approached them they started running away. I was surprised by this. Pleasantly surprised. It was rare that people ran from me, they generally fainted. I don&#39;t really blame them. How often do you see Death anyway?</p> <p>Non believers were generally the ones that reacted worse than the believers. I suppose that the believers already plan for this moment. I&#39;ve really wondered though, is it that they are closer to the truth because they believe in Me or are they further away because they do so without any real evidence. I never leave evidence.</p> <hr /> <p><strong>Newspaper article</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>Three people die as they ran into a speeding truck. The bus driver held for homicide.
